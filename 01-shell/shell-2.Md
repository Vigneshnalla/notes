### A  shebang (#!) 
- is the first line in a script file that tells the operating system what interpreter to use to execute the script. 


### `set` Commands

- **`set -x`**: Enables debugging, printing each command and its arguments as they are executed.
- **`set -e`**: Causes the script to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status (error).
- **`set -o pipefail`**: if any command in the pipeline fails  the entire pipeline returns a non-zero exit status causing the script to stop
ex:
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
set -o pipefail

echo "Starting script"
# Simulate a failure in the first command of the pipeline
non_existent_command | echo "This will not run"

echo "Script completed"

```
If you don't set set -o pipefail, the script would not fail because it only checks the exit status of the last command in the pipeline (i.e., echo "This will not run"), which would still run even if the first command fails.


### Before executing any script, it's better to check the permissions

## `chmod`
- **userPerm** - **group_perm** - **other**
  
- **`chmod 777 file.txt`**: Grants full permissions (read, write, and execute) to the user, group, and others.
- **`chmod g+w file.txt`**: Adds write permission for the group.
- **`chmod g-w file.txt`**: Removes write permission for the group.
- **`chmod g=rx file.txt`**: Sets group permissions to read and execute.
- **`chmod o+x file.txt`**: Adds execute permission for others.
- **`chmod o-x file.txt`**: Removes execute permission for others.
- **`chmod o=r file.txt`**: Sets others' permissions to read only.

## ls -ltr
- used to list the contents with detailed info and sorted by modifation time in reverse order

    drwxr-xr-x  2 user group   4096 Nov 16 09:20 directory1
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 user group   2048 Nov 17 10:45 script.sh

### `free -h`, `free -t`, `free -[m,g]`, `free -s 5`

Columns in `free` Output:
- **total**: Total memory available (physical memory + swap).
- **used**: Memory that is currently in use by processes, including cache and buffers.
- **free**: Memory that is completely free and not being used.
- **shared**: Memory that is shared between multiple processes.
- **buff/cache**: Memory used by the kernel for buffers and cache (which can be released if needed).
- **available**: Memory that is available for new processes, including free memory and reclaimable memory.

### nproc return the no of cpus
### `df` Command:
- **Purpose**: The `df` command is used to check disk space usage for file systems.

#### Common Options for `df`:
- `-h`: Displays the disk usage in a human-readable format (e.g., `MB`, `GB`).
- `-T`: Shows the file system type (e.g., ext4, xfs).
- `-a`: Displays all file systems, including dummy ones.
- `-x`: Excludes file systems of a specific type from the output.

### Output Columns Explained:
- **Filesystem**: Specifies the file system or partition (e.g., `/dev/sda1`).
  - **Use**: To know which disk or partition is being reported.

- **Size**: The total size of the file system or partition.
  - **Use**: To understand the total capacity of the file system.

- **Used**: The amount of disk space that is already used.
  - **Use**: To see how much of the disk is occupied.

- **Avail**: The amount of available (free) space.
  - **Use**: To know how much space is still free to store data.

- **Use%**: The percentage of used space on the file system.
  - **Use**: To quickly gauge how full the file system is.

- **Mounted on**: The directory where the file system is mounted.
  - **Use**: To know where the file system is being used in the directory structure (e.g., `/`, `/data`).

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Filesystem     Type  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      ext4  50G   5G    45G  10%  /
tmpfs          tmpfs  16G   1G    15G   7%  /dev/shm
/dev/sdb1      ext4  100G  20G   80G  20%  /data

```

### `top` Command:
- **Purpose**: The `top` command is used to display  real-time information about **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, and **running processes**.
- Continuously updates the information, providing live data on system performance.
- Allows you to interactively manage processes, such as killing or renicing them.

### Key Metrics Displayed by `top`:
- **PID**: Process ID â€“ Unique identifier for each process.
- **USER**: The user who owns the process.
- **PR**: Process priority.
- **VIRT**: Virtual memory used by the process.
- **RES**: Resident memory (RAM) used by the process.
- **SHR**: Shared memory used by the process.
- **S**: Process status (e.g., running, sleeping, etc.).
- **%CPU**: Percentage of CPU used by the process.
- **%MEM**: Percentage of memory used by the process.
- **TIME+**: Total CPU time used by the process.
- **COMMAND**: The command that started the process.
