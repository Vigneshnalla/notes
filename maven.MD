# What is Maven

- **Maven** is a build automation and project management tool primarily used in Java-based projects. It is free, open-source, and maintained by Apache.
- It simplifies the build process by providing a standardized way to manage project dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package the application for deployment.
- Maven uses a configuration file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model), where you define project dependencies, plugins, and other project details.
- It automates the process of downloading necessary libraries from a central repository, making it easier to manage project dependencies.

In most projects, development doesn't start from scratchâ€”Maven offers a wide range of plugins to assist with various tasks.


### Instead of developing line by line, developers can directly use already developed modules and libraries, accelerating the development process.
