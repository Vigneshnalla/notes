Application Layer

The Application Layer includes protocols that are needed to make these applications to work correctly over a network or the internet. These protocols are essential for enabling network applications to function properly.

For example, applications like Chrome, Edge, Skype, and Outlook are all network-enabled apps that rely on protocols within the Application Layer to operate. A web browser, for instance, uses protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to enable web browsing. Similarly, other network applications such as Skype and Outlook depend on various Application Layer protocols to perform their functions, such as sending messages or emails.

These protocols form the foundation for various network services like:

File Transfer (FTP) – Used for transferring files between computers.
Web Browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) – Used for navigating websites on the internet.
Email (SMTP) – Used for sending and receiving emails.
Virtual Terminals (Telnet) – Used for remote communication with other systems.
Through these protocols, we can perform many tasks, from browsing websites to sending emails, making the internet and networked services possible.

 network application is any software that enables users to interact with a network, typically over the internet or a local area network (LAN). These applications rely on network protocols to send and receive data between devices, allowing them to perform various tasks such as communication, file sharing, browsing, and more.
