We have different types of scheduling alogrithms
1) FcFs:[ first come first server]


2) SJF :[ Shortest Job First]
    - process with least burst tiem will get cpu
    we have seen that convey effect in fcfs when we were scheduling the process with higher burst time the avg time for waiting is getting increased 
    to resolve this we are sjf
    Non preemtive Version:
        - if the process get the cpu, then there is no change of preemtion again
        - it is possible that we estimates job takes 2 sec but it ends up with 20 sec

     Preemtive sheculing:

3) Priority Scheduling:
    we will assign pririority to each job no say i say that which job jas highest priority which will be executed first
