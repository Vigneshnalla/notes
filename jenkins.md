# Jenkins Overview

Jenkins is a plain server that becomes powerful only when plugins are added. 

## Adding Nodes for Load Distribution

We can add nodes to distribute the load for building multiple projects according to different environments. 

### Remote Root Directory for Logging

Ensure to configure the remote root directory for logging.

## Launch Methods

1. **Launch Agent by Connecting to the Controller**
2. **Launch Agent via SSH**

## Steps to Configure Webhook in GitHub

1. **Go to Your Repository**
2. **Go to Settings**
3. **Select Webhooks**
4. **Add Webhook**
5. **Configure the Webhook**:
   - **Payload URL**: `http://<jenkins-agent-url>:8080/github-webhook/`
     - Replace `<jenkins-agent-url>` with the actual URL of your Jenkins agent.
   - **Content type**: Select `application/json`.
   - **Secret**: (Optional) If you have configured a secret in Jenkins for security, enter it here.
   - **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**: 
     - Select **Just the push event** or **Let me select individual events** (you can select multiple events like Pull Requests, Push, etc.).
   - **Active**: Ensure the webhook is marked as **Active**.

6. **Save the Webhook**:
   - Click the **Add webhook** button to save your settings.

## Configuring Jenkins UI

1. **Go to Jenkins UI**:
   - Open your Jenkins instance in a web browser.

2. **Configure Your Job**:
   - Navigate to the job you want to configure and click on **Configure**.

3. **Build Triggers**:
   - Under the **Build Triggers** section, check **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
   - Save your configuration.

I automated the backend process by setting up CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins. First, I configured Jenkins, a Jenkins agent, and a Nexus server. I created a folder called "expense" in Jenkins, with two pipelines. The first pipeline (upstream job) pulls the backend code, navigates into the appropriate folder, takes the version from package.json, runs npm install, creates a zip file, and uploads it to Nexus. It then triggers the second pipeline (downstream job) by passing the version number.

The downstream job handles deploying the backend instance with the latest code. It reads the version parameter and uses Terraform to provision resources by running terraform apply -var="appversion={params.appVersion}". Then, using remote execution, it passes the version to Ansible, which attempts to connect to the backend instance. However, the backend instance is in a security group that doesnâ€™t allow SSH access from the Jenkins agent (due to restrictions from AWS tools). To resolve this, I had to add an inbound rule in the backend's security group to allow SSH access from all private instances within the default VPC CIDR, enabling the Jenkins agent to connect and deploy the code successfully.

After Ansible connects to the backend instance, it uses the passed version to download the corresponding code from the Nexus server. Ansible then places the zip file containing the source code in the backend instance and extracts it, ensuring the backend is running the latest version of the code.
