## What is devops
- Devops is culture that helps organizations to improve the delivery of applications by ensuring proper automation with code  quality is maintained with in the applciation  and ensuring  continous monitoring and continous testing .By integrating these processes, DevOps allows teams to deliver applications to customers with high standards of reliability and performance.

## why devops
- Before DevOps, delivering an application to end users could take months, as various engineersâ€”such as build and release engineers, test engineers, and others and also there is no proper communication betweent them 

  for suppose there is a hot fix in our application like the price of bus ticket  is  1000rs but instead of that it is showing  10 rs
  To prevent this, we need an immediate fix other wise we loss so much amount without devops it is not possible to sovle within days


DevOps solves this by enabling faster release cycles through CI/CD pipelines and allowing for rapid deployment of urgent fixes.
