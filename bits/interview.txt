What is command substitution in shell scripting?
o Explanation: Command substitution is a process that allows you to replace a 
command with its output. It's achieved by enclosing the command in 
backticks (`) or using $(command)

internet gateway:

NAT gateway --> public subnet
general use cases fetching the updates, downloading packages from internet
It enables resources in private subnets (which don’t have public IPs) to access the internet for updates or external services.
It doesn’t allow inbound connections from the internet.
We place this in public subnet



An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Ip address in two formats:
    1) 16 digit ==> 8.8.8.8 [it allows 256*256*256*256 which is approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses]
    2) 32 digit ==> 29ad:sfd8:_:... [it is divided into 8 groups of each 4 hexa digts seperated by colons]
It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface
    1) Network id: identifying specifig network
    2) host id: identifying specific device(host) within that network
public Ip: visible to external network
private Ip : used within internal networks like home or office ) not acessible fro internet directly

Subnet mask
It is used to separate the network address from the host address, allowing a router to quickly determine where to forward a packet
ADv:
    Make networks easier to maintain
    Route packets
When a router receives a data packet, it examines the destination IP address included in the packet header.
By applying the subnet mask to the destination IP address, the router can determine which part of the address refers to the network and which part refers to the host.
If Device A wants to send a packet to Device B, it checks the destination IP address (192.168.1.20).
Since both devices share the same network portion (192.168.1), Device A can send the packet directly to Device B without needing to go through a router.
