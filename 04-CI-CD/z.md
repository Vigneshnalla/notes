### CI/CD Implementation

1. **Source Code Repository & Target Platform**
   - We are using **Git** as the source code repository, and our target platform is **Kubernetes**.

2. **Code Commit & CI/CD Orchestrator**
   - When a developer pushes code into the Git repository, **CI/CD orchestrators** like **Jenkins** are used.
   - Once a code commit is made in **GitHub**, it triggers a notification to Jenkins, which then starts the build process.

#### First Stage: Checkout & Build

- **Checkout Stage:**
  - First, we checkout the code from the Git repository.
  - We also perform **static code analysis** at this stage to ensure code quality.

- **Build and Unit Test:**
  - Once the code is checked out, **unit testing** and **static code analysis** are performed.
  - After the tests, **code scanning** is done to identify security vulnerabilities using tools like **SonarQube** to ensure the code is secure.

- **Image Building:**
  - We create a **Docker image** using a **Dockerfile** located in the image repository.
  - Once the image is built, it is immediately scanned for issues like default packages, base image vulnerabilities, etc.

- **Push Image to Registry:**
  - The validated Docker image is pushed to a **Docker registry** like **Docker Hub** or **Amazon ECR** for storage.

#### Continuous Deployment

- **Image Manifest Storage:**
  - The image manifest is stored in a separate repository to maintain versioning and track image changes.

- **Updating the Manifest:**
  - The image in the manifest file is updated to reflect the new image version after the build.

- **GitOps for Deployment:**
  - Using **ArgoCD** (or **Ansible**), we deploy the changes to **Kubernetes**.
  - **GitOps** practices are followed to manage the deployment process, ensuring that the desired state of the infrastructure is always maintained.
